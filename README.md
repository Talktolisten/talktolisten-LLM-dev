# Dataset, Generation Pipeline, and Model for RolePlay LLM

### Talk To Listen Dataset
- The Dataset is hosted on Huggingface Hub and can be accessed [here](https://huggingface.co/collections/hieunguyenminh/roleplay-llm-65aaaf61c2eef2ba117f4ecf)
- The dataset is generated by multiple models such as Gemini Pro (Google), GPT 3.5, Mistral Medium.
- The dataset is can be used to fine-tune the models to generate conversational AI to embody a wide range of original characters, each with a unique persona. It includes fictional characters, complete with their own backgrounds, core traits, relationships, goals, and distinct speaking styles.

### Model Fiene-tuning Pipeline
- The model is hosted on Huggingface Hub and can be accessed [here](https://huggingface.co/hieunguyenminh/v3)
- Script: TTL_RolePlay.ipynb
- Fine-tune from opensource model [TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ) using QLoRA and Supervised Learning.
